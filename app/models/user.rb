          Private channels will only be seen by the users that you add to the channel. Direct messages are also private so no one outside of this channel will be able to see this conversation.
          To add a user to your channel, click on the Details button and a button to add members will appear on the top right. You can then search for and add any member of ChatHero.
          If you have questions or feedback, be sure to leave Ryan a message!
